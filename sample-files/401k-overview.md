# 401(k) Plan Overview

A 401(k) is a retirement savings plan sponsored by an employer. It lets workers save and invest a portion of their paycheck before taxes are taken out. Taxes aren't paid until the money is withdrawn from the account.

## Key Features

1. **Tax Advantages**: Contributions are made with pre-tax dollars, reducing your taxable income for the year.
2. **Employer Matching**: Many employers match a percentage of employee contributions, essentially providing free money.
3. **Automatic Savings**: Contributions are automatically deducted from your paycheck, making saving easier.
4. **Investment Options**: Plans typically offer a range of investment options, including mutual funds and target-date funds.
5. **Vesting**: Employer contributions may be subject to a vesting schedule.

## Types of 401(k) Plans

1. **Traditional 401(k)**: Contributions are made pre-tax, and withdrawals in retirement are taxed as ordinary income.
2. **Roth 401(k)**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals in retirement are tax-free.
