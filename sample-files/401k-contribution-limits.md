# 401(k) Contribution Limits

Understanding contribution limits is crucial for maximizing your 401(k) savings. These limits are set by the IRS and can change annually.

## 2023 Contribution Limits

### Employee Elective Deferrals
- **Under 50 years old**: $22,500 per year
- **50 years or older**: Additional $7,500 catch-up contribution allowed, totaling $30,000

### Total Contribution Limits (Employee + Employer)
- **Under 50 years old**: $66,000 or 100% of compensation, whichever is less
- **50 years or older**: $73,500 (including catch-up contributions) or 100% of compensation, whichever is less

## Important Notes

1. **Employer Contributions**: These don't count toward your elective deferral limit but do count toward the total contribution limit.

2. **Highly Compensated Employees (HCEs)**: May have additional restrictions based on non-discrimination testing.

3. **Multiple 401(k) Plans**: If you have multiple 401(k) accounts, your total elective deferrals to all plans can't exceed the annual limit.

4. **After-Tax Contributions**: Some plans allow after-tax contributions beyond the elective deferral limit, up to the total contribution limit.

5. **Roth 401(k)**: Contributions to a Roth 401(k) count toward the same annual limit as traditional 401(k) contributions.

Always check with your plan administrator or a financial advisor for the most up-to-date information and how it applies to your specific situation.
